<h3> for output check console </h3>

    <p> <strong>Reason for the output of this code snippet:- </strong>

      <h3> RESULT : </h3>
      <p> VALUE a :'a' will have undefined value because of the hoists concept, declaration comes before execution of the variable but initialization of variable is absent hence we get undefined as a value</p>
      <p> VALUE fun() : fun() will be called in console.log statement and body will come before the execution of fun() and will return 2 as value on console .
